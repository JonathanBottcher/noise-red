Reduce noise coming from your microphone.

***Usage***\
Add file to ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets 

***TODO***\
bugfix: the noise cancellation configuration gets applied automatically, but the user has to set the volume coming from the microphone manually in the sound settings. 
feature: Add some visual effect/small icon to be able to tell if the configuration is turned off or turned on.
